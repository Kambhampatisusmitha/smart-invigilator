AI-Driven Autonomous Exam Hall Monitoring System
This project presents an innovative 
solution to enhance examination monitoring by integrating advanced technologies such as
artificial intelligence, computer vision, and real-time data analytics. Through the use of 
strategically placed surveillance cameras and sophisticated image processing algorithms, the
system ensures continuous monitoring of examinee behavior, detecting unauthorized materials 
and suspicious activities in real-time. By addressing common cheating behaviors such as
whispering, excessive head movements, hand gestures, and physical contact, this project 
safeguards the integrity and credibility of examinations. Additionally, emotion recognition 
technology provides insights into students' emotional states, identifying potential stress or anxiety 
that could indicate dishonest practices.
